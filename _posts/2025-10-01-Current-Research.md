### üåå Introduction

When I first began studying quasars, I was captivated by how much we could learn from just **light curves** ‚Äî variations in brightness over time.  
Light, in this context, is not merely illumination but a **messenger from the distant universe**, carrying information about black holes, gas clouds, and cosmic structure.

At the **University of Connecticut**, under the mentorship of **Hugh Sharp** and **Dr. Jonathan Trump**, I embarked on a project exploring **photometric reverberation mapping (PRM)** ‚Äî a method to estimate the scale of a quasar‚Äôs **Broad-Line Region (BLR)** using only photometric (broadband) data.

### üî≠ What is Reverberation Mapping?

Reverberation Mapping (RM) traditionally measures **time lags** between continuum emission (from the accretion disk) and emission lines (from the BLR).  
These time delays tell us how far the BLR gas lies from the black hole, allowing us to **estimate black hole masses** and study accretion physics.

Spectroscopic RM, though powerful, is **expensive and resource-intensive**.  
Photometric RM aims to simplify this ‚Äî using multi-band photometry, where certain filters are contaminated by emission-line flux. This contamination encodes the same lag information but at a fraction of the cost.

### üß© My Work

In my ongoing project, I analyze both **observational and simulated light curves** to assess whether emission-line contamination in broadband filters can accurately reproduce BLR size scales.  
This approach could make RM studies **accessible to large-scale surveys**, such as **Rubin Observatory‚Äôs LSST**.

Through this work, I‚Äôve developed expertise in:

- Python-based **time series analysis**
- **Cross-correlation** techniques for lag detection
- Working with **continuum vs. emission-line light curves**
- Handling and visualizing **large photometric datasets**

### üöÄ Looking Ahead

The potential of PRM is enormous ‚Äî especially with the next generation of time-domain surveys.  
If successful, it can democratize access to quasar-scale measurements, turning every deep-field photometric survey into a laboratory for black hole physics.

This project has deepened my appreciation for **how theory, data, and software converge** in modern astrophysics.  
What started as code on a laptop has become a small contribution to understanding some of the **brightest and most mysterious objects** in the universe.
