## 🛠 Projects

### 🔹 Photometric Reverberation Mapping of Quasars
Researching **accretion disk light curve lags** to map quasar broad-line regions (BLR) using photometric RM.  
Explores the use of continuum–emission line contamination as a **low-cost alternative** to spectroscopic RM.

### 🔹 Quantum Dynamics on Classical and Quantum Computers
Simulated **spin-½ chain dynamics** in Python and implemented quantum algorithms on **IBM Quantum** hardware.  
Compared classical vs. quantum computational capabilities for time-evolution simulations.

### 🔹 Broad Emission-Line Variability in Luminous Quasars
Analyzed **time-series spectra** of AGN to probe BLR geometry and variability through **reverberation mapping**.

### 🔹 Eversource Energy Center Internship
Worked on **power system coordination and modeling** under Dr. Zongjie Wang.  
Organized and analyzed research papers on transmission and distribution (T&D) systems to support EEC research efforts.

### 🔹 Bridge Program Course Instructor
Served as **lead instructor for Physics I**, teaching introductory mechanics for UConn’s Bridge program.  
Designed lessons and labs to prepare underrepresented incoming STEM students for university-level physics.
